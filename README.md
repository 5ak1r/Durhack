To run this game, download a ZIP file of all contents and run Main.py. This should launch the PYGAME GUI.

Project brief:

The concept of infinity is an intriguing one. The classic Conwayâ€™s Game of Life has many unique aspects: Turing-completeness, being a zero-player game and its fascinating complexity. 

This game provides an opportunity to play this classic game with another player. Player 1 has blue cells, and player 2 with red cells, and they each place 10 on the grid.  All original rules apply, except when a certain cell is surrounded by other coloured cells, its survivability depends on the majority-colour. So, this quickly turns into a competitive game!

Coding this was challenging at first because none of us have had any game developing experience before. Working with the GUI proved tricky initially, but we much teamwork we managed to get it working! The next stage for The Pixel Petri Dish would be to introduce an AI-based program to select cell placement, so a player can play against the computer.
